# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification on Iris Dataset

This repository presents a complete implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using the Iris dataset for classification, created by Kavyakambhampati as part of the AI & ML Internship Task 6.

## Project Overview
- Loaded and normalized Iris dataset features for improved accuracy.
- Split dataset into training and testing sets to validate model performance.
- Tested various K values to identify the best neighbor count.
- Evaluated results using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualized decision boundaries with petal length and width features to illustrate classification areas.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies via pip:
    ```bash
